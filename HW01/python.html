                <p>
                    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
                    Known for its clear syntax and readability, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language's philosophy emphasizes simplicity and explicitness, as outlined in "The Zen of Python" document. 
                    Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
                    It features dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and a comprehensive standard library that supports many common programming tasks.

            <h2>Key Features of Python</h2>
            
            <div class="type-grid">
                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Easy to Learn and Read</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and closely resembles natural English, making it an ideal first language for beginners. 
                        The use of indentation to define code blocks rather than brackets makes the code structure visually clear. 
                        This readability reduces the cost of program maintenance and development.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Extensive Libraries</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules for everything from file I/O to web services. 
                        Additional libraries like NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, and Django for web development extend Python's capabilities even further. 
                        This rich ecosystem means you rarely need to write everything from scratch.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python code can run on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix without modification. 
                        This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Python extremely portable. 
                        The same Python script will work across different platforms, saving development time and effort.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Dynamic Typing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Variables in Python don't require explicit type declarations, as the interpreter determines the type at runtime. 
                        This flexibility speeds up development but requires careful testing to catch type-related errors. 
                        Python's duck typing philosophy means that object compatibility is determined by behavior rather than inheritance.

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Follow PEP 8 Style Guide:</strong> This official Python style guide ensures your code is readable and consistent. 
                        It covers naming conventions, indentation, and code organization. 
                        Many IDEs can automatically format your code to follow PEP 8 standards.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Write clear and descriptive variable names that explain their purpose. 
                        Use comments to explain complex logic, but write code that is self-explanatory when possible. 
                        Good naming conventions reduce the need for excessive comments.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Take advantage of Python's built-in functions and standard library before writing custom solutions. 
                        Libraries like itertools and collections offer optimized implementations of common patterns. 
                        Understanding what's available saves time and improves code quality.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use virtual environments to manage project dependencies and avoid version conflicts. 
                        Tools like venv or conda create isolated Python environments for each project. 
                        This practice is essential for maintaining clean development setups and easy deployment.
