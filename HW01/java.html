                <p>
                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. 
                    The language was created with the philosophy of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any platform that supports Java without recompilation. 
                    This cross-platform capability, combined with robust security features and automatic memory management, made Java enormously popular for enterprise applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java code compiles to bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), an abstraction layer between the program and the operating system. 
                    This architecture provides platform independence while maintaining good performance. 
                    The language includes extensive standard libraries covering everything from data structures to networking, making it suitable for building complete applications without external dependencies.

            <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
            
            <div class="type-grid">
                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        Java enforces object-oriented design through classes and objects, encouraging modular and reusable code. 
                        Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are fundamental to Java programming. 
                        Everything in Java is an object (except primitive types), promoting a consistent programming model throughout applications.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Platform Independence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Java bytecode runs on any system with a JVM installed, eliminating the need to compile separately for different operating systems. 
                        This makes Java ideal for applications that must run across diverse environments. 
                        The "write once, run anywhere" capability significantly reduces deployment complexity and maintenance costs.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Automatic Memory Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Java's garbage collector automatically reclaims memory from objects no longer in use, preventing memory leaks. 
                        Programmers don't need to manually allocate and free memory as in C or C++. 
                        This automation reduces bugs and allows developers to focus on business logic rather than memory management details.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-card">
                    <h3>Rich Standard Library</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Java Class Library provides thousands of pre-built classes for common programming tasks. 
                        From collections and I/O to networking and GUI development, extensive APIs are available out of the box. 
                        This comprehensive ecosystem accelerates development by providing tested, reliable components for most programming needs.

            <h2>Java Development Best Practices:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Follow naming conventions:</strong> Use camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes. 
                        Consistent naming makes code more readable and helps other developers understand your intent. 
                        Most Java projects follow these conventions, making them a de facto standard in the community.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Understand and properly use access modifiers (public, private, protected) to encapsulate your code. 
                        Keep fields private and provide public methods for controlled access when necessary. 
                        Proper encapsulation prevents unintended modifications and makes code easier to maintain and refactor.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Learn exception handling thoroughly, using try-catch blocks appropriately and creating custom exceptions when needed. 
                        Don't catch exceptions unless you can handle them meaningfully. 
                        Proper exception handling makes applications more robust and helps identify problems during development and production.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Utilize interfaces and abstract classes to create flexible, maintainable designs following SOLID principles. 
                        Favor composition over inheritance to avoid tight coupling between classes. 
                        Design patterns like Factory, Observer, and Strategy solve common problems in object-oriented design.
